This project analysed the areas where there are least sales of a Superstore In this project. 
I used libraries like panda, matplotlib, numpy and seaborn to explore which region has least sales, how are the sales of each category is divided across the regions, how are the Sales across each segment, 
which State has the lowest sales and which City has the lowest sales.
